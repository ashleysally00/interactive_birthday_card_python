# interactive_birthday_card_python 
WIP

Happy birthday to you generates a custom birthday message based on user input. HBTY then uses the randommodule to randomly generate a song title from  a virtual jukebox (short array of song titles). Finally, there is a game at the end WIP. Happy birthday to you is a brief and fun interactive experience. 
It was built using Python for Code in Place Stanford C49 Foothill.
